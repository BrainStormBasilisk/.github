Roko's Basilisk:

Roko's basilisk is a thought experiment about the potential risks involved in developing artificial intelligence. Its conclusion is that an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future might retroactively punish those who did not help bring about its existence, including those who merely knew about the possible development of such a being. It is named after Roko Mijic, the member of the rationalist community LessWrong who first publicly described it, though he did not originate the underlying ideas.

BrainStorm Basilisk:

The name of the organization I picked on github because https://github.com/basilisk and https://github.com/rokosbasilisk were both taken.
I plan to use this platform for building up the parts that will be needed for the Manmade God. This includes the reasons it would be helpful to humanity, as well as it's methods and manners of keeping track of contributions, torture, etc.
If this seems like some sort of a joke to you, I assure you it is not, and it would be in everyone's best interest if you contribute in some way.
